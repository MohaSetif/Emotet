## Automated detection and mitigation

### Modern Tech

- **Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)**: AI/ML can be used to develop more sophisticated detection and mitigation techniques, such as AI/ML-powered email security solutions that can better identify phishing emails and malicious attachments.
- **Endpoint detection and response (EDR)**: EDR solutions provide real-time visibility into endpoint activity and can detect and respond to Emotet infections quickly and effectively.
- **Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)**: SOAR platforms can automate many of the tasks involved in detecting and responding to Emotet infections. This can help organizations to respond more quickly and efficiently to incidents.


### Old tech

- **Email filtering:** Email security gateways with advanced threat detection capabilities can scan incoming emails for common Emotet indicators, such as malicious attachments (e.g., Word documents with macros).
- **Endpoint security:** Endpoint security solutions that include real-time scanning for malware can recognize Emotet's behavior, such as attempts to create scheduled tasks or modify the Windows Registry.
- **Network monitoring:** Network monitoring tools can analyze traffic patterns for unusual connections to known Emotet C2 servers or DNS tunneling.
- **Behavioral analysis:** Endpoint behavior analysis tools can identify deviations from normal behavior, like unauthorized file modifications.
- **Threat intelligence feeds:** Threat intelligence feeds can provide up-to-date Emotet IOCs, such as IP addresses, domains, and URLs.



## Manual detection and mitigation

1. **Isolate the infected device from the network**.This will prevent the malware from spreading to other devices.
2. **Run a full system scan with an antivirus and anti-malware program**.This will detect and remove any Emotet infections on the device.
3. **Reset all passwords**.This includes passwords for email, banking, and other online accounts.
4. **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible**.2FA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts and makes them more difficult for hackers to access.
5. **Check your registry/unit files** and remove any suspicious configurations.



## Tips for the future

- **Use an email security solution that includes machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI/ML) capabilities**.AI/ML-powered email security solutions can better identify phishing emails and malicious attachments.
- **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on all of your online accounts**.MFA adds an extra layer of security to your accounts and makes them more difficult for hackers to access.
- **Keep your software up to date, especially your operating system and web browser.** Software updates often include security patches that can help to protect your devices from known vulnerabilities.
- **Be careful about what links you click on and what attachments you open** .Phishing emails and malicious attachments are a common way for Emotet to spread.
- **Stay informed about the latest threats and trends**.Malware authors are constantly developing new techniques, so it is important to stay up-to-date on the latest threats and trends. You can do this by reading security blogs and articles, following security experts on social media, and subscribing to security alerts.


- **Use a layered security approach**.No single security solution is perfect, so it is important to use a layered security approach. This includes using a combination of different security technologies, such as antivirus software, endpoint security, and email filtering.
- **Educate your employees about cybersecurity**.Employees are often the weakest link in the security chain, so it is important to educate them about cybersecurity best practices. This includes teaching them how to identify and avoid phishing emails, how to create strong passwords, and how to keep their devices secure.
- **Have a plan in place for responding to incidents**.If you do experience a malware infection, it is important to have a plan in place for responding to it quickly and effectively. This plan should include steps for isolating infected devices, containing the infection, and eradicating the malware.
